In this project, I’m presented with data on the bank customer. Data includes Tenure, Transaction frequency, Credit limit etc. Bank wants to divide its customers into at least 3 distinct groups. Here I’m using K-mean clustering to divide the customer into a distinct group. Tools: Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn. Using K-mean grouped the customer in to 4 category: Transactor: Customer who pay least amount of interest Revolvers: Customer who use their credit card as a loan New Customers: New Customer with low tenure VIP/Prime: Customer with high Credit limit
