In this project, I'm presented with data on the bank customer for past  6month.
Data includes Tenure, Transaction frequency, Credit limit etc.
Bank wants to divide its cutomer in to atleast 3 distinct group.
Here I'm using K-mean clusturing to divide the customer in to distinct group.
Tools: Jupyter Notbook, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn.
Using K-mean grouped the customer in to 4 category: Transactor: Customer who pay least amount of interest Revolvers: Customer who use their credit card as a loan New Customers: New Customer with low tenure VIP/Prime: Customer with high Credit limit
